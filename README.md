# JavaScript Coding Nights - Project Starter

## Step 1: Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/jscodingnights/jscn-project-starter.git
```

## Step 2: Create a branch for your work on the night's task:

```
git checkout -b us-presidents
```

## Step 3: Create the project from one of the client starters

For example, if you're working on the "us-presidents" challenge (this name is arbitrary), and you want to use React for the web, copy the clients/React (this name is NOT arbitrary) folder into /challenges:

```
cp -r clients/React challenges/us-presidents
```

## Step 4: Open your project, npm install, and start coding!

```
cd challenges/us-presidents
npm install
npm start
```
