# JavaScript Coding Nights - Project Starter
This project will serve as the framework for future JSCN meetups.  It will allow people to work on their projects over time in one place, and more importantly (for me :)) it will allow for infrastructure reuse going forward.

## Challenges

* [US Presidents](/challenges/us-presidents) - Create a voting app and choose the next leader of the free world!

## Client Setup

### Step 1: Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/jscodingnights/jscn-project-starter.git
```

### Step 2: Create a branch for your work on the night's task:

```
git checkout -b us-presidents
```

### Step 3: Create the project from one of the client starters

For example, if you're working on the "us-presidents" challenge (this name is arbitrary), and you want to use React for the web, copy the clients/React (this name is NOT arbitrary) folder into /challenges:

```
cp -r clients/React challenges/us-presidents
```

### Step 4: Open your project, npm install, and start coding!

```
cd challenges/us-presidents
npm install
npm start
```
