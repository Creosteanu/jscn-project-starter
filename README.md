# us-presidents

## Idea Specification

Create an app that allows a citizen to cast their vote.  

Citizens can see a list of candidates and vote for one of them.  
Citizens can vote as much as they like, but only the last one counts.
Citizens can see which candidate was voted for by every other citizen.
Citizens can see which candidate is the current winner


Vote for the next US president, using React or whatever client of choice

You do not need to log in. :)

React is a view engine!  Focus on good looking UI, or pick one single bit of functionality to focus on.


What I recommend if you want to do React + Redux:
Focus on consuming the summary API
Create a single reducer for consuming that data
Use react-redux to connect react components to the global state
Make a nice UI for the data there

Master bootstrap for playing around that has everything installed and configured, with certain libraries marked as npm install.



App for making sample projects.
